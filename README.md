Task is to create a notes app in JS as a web app. Users can add, edit and remove notes. 
List of notes is displayed in a form of table (HTML representation may vary: table, divs etc). The columns are time of creation, note content, note category. Categories are predefined: “Task”, “Random Thought”, “Idea”.
Users can archive notes. Archived notes are not shown in the notes list. Users can view archived notes and unarchive them.
There is also a summary table which counts notes by categories: separately for active and archived. The table is updated whenever users perform some action on notes. The summary table is shown on the same page as the notes table.
